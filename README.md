# Draft Code of Conduct for the ECMLPKDD conference

This repo is meant as a central point of contact for the Draft Code of Conduct for the [ECMLPKDD2020](https://ecmlpkdd2020.net/) conference. Feel free to participate. 

The main document is [draft.md](draft.md). It was originally adopted by @HeidiBaya from the code of conduct for [useR! 2020](https://user2020.r-project.org/codeofconduct/) and posted [here](https://hackmd.io/sXV_Et2lRfShUiGOjSHLGw?edit).

You have questions, comments, ideas or feedback, please open an [issue](https://github.com/teaching-ml/draft_ecmlpkdd_coc/issues).

## Contributing

We welcome constructive contributions that help push the code of conduct further and make it ready for submission to the ECMLPKDD steering committee. If you'd like to help, please consider to send us a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) with the changes you suggest.

In order to merge a Pull Requests, we try to follow a 4-eyes-principle. In order for a PR to merge, the contribution needs to be reviewed. If approved, the submitter must not be the person to merge. With this, we hope to establish a transparent and fair but yet efficient way to shape our code of conduct.
